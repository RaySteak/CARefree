HTTP Ground truth time to get (averaged over 20 measurements):
80x60 pooled image,                     4800B -> 0.215607s
// Doesn't really make sense to do jpg on the pooled image as it's already small enough,
// and would lose even more quality. Could try though.
160x120 original image jpeg quality 50 ~1500-2000B -> 0.163924s
160x120 original image jpeg quality 12, ~600-1000B -> 0.139988s

Time for getting back aggregate (not taking into consideration the AWS processing time),
as aggregate is received from same topic that is posted
Big 2-layer model of 29207 parametesrs: 11.791269600000001s
Small 1-layer model of 4049 parameters: 1.904461s
Small 1 layer model with even more
dumbed down HoG of 567 parameters (that was created for using face detection but
waas still not small enough to not run out of memory): 0.425408s
